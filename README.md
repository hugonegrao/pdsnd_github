### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Final Project - Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree

### Description
In this project, we will explore data provided by Motivate (a bike share system provider) related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

This work was made in Python creating an interactive experience in the terminal in order to discover bike share usage patterns using a variety of descriptive statistics, such as:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time) 

- most common month 

- most common day of week 

- most common hour of day 

#2 Popular stations and trip 

- most common start station 

- most common end station 

- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station) 

#3 Trip duration 

- total travel time 

- average travel time 

#4 User info

- counts of each user type 

- counts of each gender 

- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth 

### Files used
- bikeshare.py 

- chicago.csv 

- new_york_city.csv 

- washington.csv
